# Climate-Analysis-and-Exploration
Climate Analysis and Exploration

This is a solo project to analyze the effects of latitude on climate. For the project, I created a Python script to visualize the weather from a random sample of 500+ cities across the world. I created scatterplots to visual the relationship between latitude and aspects of climate including temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.
I then ran linear regressions on each relationship for both the Northern an Southern Hemispheres.
Finally I created a humidity heatmap for the cities and ploted hotels that were in areas of attractive climates using googlemaps.
####Tools/Packages Used:
* Pandas
* Time
* Matplotlib
* Scipy.stats
 
![Temperature vs Latitude Plot](/output_data/Temp_Lat.png)

This plot shows the relationship between average temperature and latitude for the cities generated. 
There is a visible linear relationship between Latitude and temperature, especially for the northern hemisphere.
