# Climate-Analysis-and-Exploration
Climate Analysis and Exploration

A solo project to analyze the effects of latitude on climate 
In this example, I created a Python script to visualize the weather from a random sample of 500+ cities across the world. I created scatterplots to visual the relationship between latitude and aspects of climate including temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.
I then ran linear regressions on each relationship for both the Northern an Southern Hemispheres (
Finally I created a humidity heatmap for the cities and ploted hotels that were in areas of attractive climates using googlemaps.
Tools/Packages Used:Pandas, Time, Matplotlib, APIs, Scipy.stats
